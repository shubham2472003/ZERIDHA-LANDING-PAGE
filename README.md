Summary
In this project, I have created a simple landing page for a Zerodha app using HTML and CSS. The page includes a header section, main content section, text section, and a sign-up button. I have used external CSS files for better maintainability and separation of concerns, instead of inline CSS. The page features the Zerodha logo, a photo, and a sign-up button. I have also implemented the cursor property to change the mouse pointer to a hand when hovering over the text and buttons.
